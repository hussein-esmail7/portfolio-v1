          <p>
            I am a first year CMS student at UofT preparing for a CS specialist
            program. I am extremely ambitous and am pursuing my goal of being an
            entrepreneur. I am currently working on web/app development for my
            startup, but I know I still have a long journey to expand my skills
            and experience before this goal is reached. Aside from profession, I
            am quite adventurous and enjoy activities such as snowboarding,
            camping and rock climbing.

            I worked at McDonaldâ€™s as my very first job. Although it is grueling
            work, here I learned crucial skills that would benefit me in my
            future career such as communication, teamwork and the ability to
            work under high stress and pressure.

            This was my first tech job as an aspiring developer and the valuable

            documentation is an important stepping stone towards my final goal.

            The following summer I was rehired to work in the IT department. In
            this next step in my career, I was exposed to the vital
            inner-workings of IT such as service desk, network, security, and
            tech.
